API.AI Graphviz
===============

Render graphs based on API.AI intents.

Pre-Conditions
--------------

API.AI doesn't have a way to "group" intents, that is, a way to say that one intent is related to others.

For simplicity, you should name intents that relate to each other by name. Example: name _signup-name_ for all signup related intents

Based on:
---------
